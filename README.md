# ahk_resize_window
Resize program window to fit on multiple monitors


## Motivation

Vmware donâ€™t have nice multiple desktop support like Virtual Box.  Multiple desktops using VMware have to be full screen and it revert to single monitor when you pause and start the machine.

Solution I found is maximising entire VMware screen on multiple desktop. This way it can be restored with no problem. However not every vmware machine need to be spread at multiple desktop. Ahk_resize_window script solve this issue by pressing hot key on the vm machine that need to be spanned across monitors.  


## Installation

Install Autohotkey software and run the script.

## API Reference

## Tests

Activate vmware screen or any other window and press CTRL+B key to span it accros monitors
Activate vmware screen or any other window and press CTRL+1 to move a program window to second window and maximize it.
 
Note: Currently this script only works with dual monitor setup when main monitor is at button and second monitor is at top.
